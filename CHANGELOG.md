## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - Feature-Complete MVP

Astrolabe v1.0 represents a complete, production-ready implementation of a browser-based Vega-Lite snippet manager. The application is fully functional with no known critical bugs.

**Development Timeline**: October 2024 - October 2025

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Zero external dependencies (beyond CDN libraries)
- No build tools required
- 100% local-first architecture
- Comprehensive dataset management system
- Professional UX with keyboard shortcuts and notifications

**Known Limitations**:
- Experimental dark theme has minor visibility issues
- No cross-device synchronization (future feature)
- Storage limited to browser (no cloud backup)
- Primarily tested in Chrome/Chromium browsers

**Browser Compatibility**:
- Chrome/Chromium: Fully tested and supported
- Firefox: Likely compatible, not exhaustively tested
- Safari: Likely compatible, not exhaustively tested
- IE11: Not supported (requires modern ES6+ features)
