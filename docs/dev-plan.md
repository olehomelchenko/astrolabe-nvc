# Astrolabe Development Plan

**A lightweight, browser-based snippet manager for Vega-Lite visualizations**

> **For AI Context**: See `CLAUDE.md` for current status and key patterns.
> **This Document**: Complete development roadmap and technical decisions.

## Project Vision

Astrolabe is a focused tool for managing, editing, and previewing Vega-Lite visualization specifications. It emphasizes efficient snippet management with a clean, resizable three-panel interface: snippet library, Monaco editor with schema-aware autocomplete, and live preview.

## Design Principles

- **Local-first**: All data stored in browser (localStorage, future IndexedDB migration)
- **Minimal dependencies**: Vanilla JavaScript, no build tools, direct CDN imports
- **Developer-friendly**: Full JSON schema support, syntax validation, and intellisense
- **Version-aware**: Draft/published workflow for safe experimentation
- **Dataset management**: Separate storage for datasets with reference system
- **Extensible**: Clean architecture for future cloud sync and authentication

## Planned Feature Set

- Resizable three-panel layout with show/hide toggles
- Auto-saving draft system with explicit publishing
- Snippet organization with sorting and search
- Storage monitoring and size tracking
- Export/import functionality
- Dataset library and management
- (Future) Authentication and cloud synchronization

## Development Roadmap

### **Phase 0: Storage Architecture Design** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Define data structures that accommodate full feature set

- [x] Design snippet schema: `{id, name, created, modified, spec, draftSpec, comment, tags[], datasetRefs[], meta}`
- [x] Design dataset schema: `{id, name, created, modified, data, format, rowCount, columnCount, size, columns, comment, tags, meta}`
- [x] Design settings schema: `{panelWidths[], panelVisibility[], autoSaveDelay, meta}`
- [x] Plan localStorage key structure and namespacing
- [x] Define upgrade/migration path for schema changes
- [x] Document storage architecture decisions (see storage-examples.md)

**Deliverable**: Documented data model that supports all planned features

**Key Decisions Made**:
- ID generation: `Date.now() + random numbers` for uniqueness
- Auto-naming: ISO datetime format for default snippet names
- Draft/published workflow: separate `spec` and `draftSpec` fields
- Computed metadata: automatic calculation of size, rowCount, columns for datasets
- Extensibility: `meta` field in all schemas for future enhancements
- Settings persistence: panel state and UI preferences stored locally
